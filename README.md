# web_scraping_by_Python_Selenium

Follow the [documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/browser_manipulation/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjo9yFHoUl8) tutorial to learn *Selenium WebDriver* to scrap data from the web. Quite a different experience compared to the *beautifulsoup*.

I used google Chrome as my drowser to play around. The sandbox website for scraping is [here](http://econpy.pythonanywhere.com/ex/001.html). Also, the csv file was able to exported as well.
